# Google Data analytics Professional Certificate

Excited to share the news of completion of Google Data Analytics professional certificate. ðŸ“Š 

Consisting of 8 core courses, this certificate had 100+ video lectures, 30+ assessment tests and much more. I was able to develop skills in tools like Microsoft Excel, Google sheets, Tableau, Power BI RStudio and SQL server. Some were part of the courses and others were developed out of passion.

This certificate allowed me to enter the fascinating word of data analytics with a strong base. I look forward to exploring more advanced topics and techniques and applying them to real-world problems.
